## What is it
This was a university project made to demonstrate (in a primitive yet fun 2D-view) the flow of internet packets through a complicated computer network.

## How to run
* ```cargo run```

## Controls
* `Space` - send packets
* `LMB` - set source node
* `RMB` - set destination node
* `D` - toggle Dijkstra shortest path algorithm
* `Backspace` - toggle 'echo-bounce' mode
* `Minus` - toggle slow mode
* `Delete` - toggle 'forget' mode
* `Esc` - exit
